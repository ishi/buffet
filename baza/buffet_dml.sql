W 1812 miały miejsce dwa ważne wydarzenia w jego życiu: 16 maja umarł jego ojciec, a nieco później przez Nowogródek przeszły wojska Napoleona, maszerujące na Moskwę. Miasto Mickiewicza opanowała atmosfera radości i nadziei na koniec niewoli, jednak kilka miesięcy później ta sama Wielka Armia napoleońska wróciła rozbita i pokonana przez Rosjan.\r\n\r\nW 1815 Mickiewicz wyjechał do Wilna w celu podjęcia studiów. Studiował nauki humanistyczne na Uniwersytecie Wileńskim – czołowej uczelni dawnego Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskiego. Studia podjął na Wydziale Nauk Fizycznych i Matematycznych, uczęszczając jednocześnie na wykłady Wydziału Nauk Moralnych i Politycznych oraz Literatury i Sztuk Wyzwolonych. Ciężka sytuacja materialna rodziny po śmierci ojca skłoniła go do podjęcia nauki w uniwersyteckim Seminarium Nauczycielskim, co gwarantowało później zatrudnienie w szkołach carskich. Studia ukończył w 1819 ze stopniem magistra.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

(4, 'KARTA', 'To jest treść podstrony "karta". Co by tu jeszcze napisać. Moze znowu coś o Adamie Mickiewczu. Adam Mickiewicz był synem Mikołaja Mickiewicza herbu Poraj, adwokata sądowego w Nowogródku i komornika mińskiego oraz Barbary z Majewskich, córki ekonoma z pobliskiego Czombrowa.\n\nW latach 1807–1815 uczęszczał do dominikańskiej szkoły powiatowej w Nowogródku. W 1812 miały miejsce dwa ważne wydarzenia w jego życiu: 16 maja umarł jego ojciec, a nieco później przez Nowogródek przeszły wojska Napoleona, maszerujące na Moskwę. Miasto Mickiewicza opanowała atmosfera radości i nadziei na koniec niewoli, jednak kilka miesięcy później ta sama Wielka Armia napoleońska wróciła rozbita i pokonana przez Rosjan.\n\nW 1815 Mickiewicz wyjechał do Wilna w celu podjęcia studiów. Studiował nauki humanistyczne na Uniwersytecie Wileńskim – czołowej uczelni dawnego Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskiego. Studia podjął na Wydziale Nauk Fizycznych i Matematycznych, uczęszczając jednocześnie na wykłady Wydziału Nauk Moralnych i Politycznych oraz Literatury i Sztuk Wyzwolonych. Ciężka sytuacja materialna rodziny po śmierci ojca skłoniła go do podjęcia nauki w uniwersyteckim Seminarium Nauczycielskim, co gwarantowało później zatrudnienie w szkołach carskich. Studia ukończył w 1819 ze stopniem magistra[12].\n\nW okresie studiów w październiku 1817 wespół z Tomaszem Zanem i grupą przyjaciół założył towarzystwo Filomatów, organizację na wzór wolnomularski, która z czasem przekształciła się w spiskową organizację narodowo-patriotyczną. Związek Filomatów, nieco później założony związek Filaretów oraz Promieniści służyły organicznej pracy edukacyjno-patriotycznej polskiej młodzieży wileńskiej tamtego okresu. Organizacje te w 1822 roku liczyły już ponad 200 członków[13]. Ich aktywność, cele i coraz wyraźniejsze proniepodległościowe aspiracje nie uszły czujnej uwadze carskich służb policyjnych. Okres końca lat dwudziestych XIX wieku był też świadkiem niespełnionej wielkiej młodzieńczej miłości Mickiewicza do Maryli Wer', 6, '2012-04-01 01:58:27', 'root', 'Here should be page with information about our card.\n\nKurt Donald Cobain was an American singer-songwriter, musician and artist, best known as the lead singer and guitarist of the grunge band Nirvana. Cobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington in 1985 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene, having its debut album Bleach released on the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989.');
