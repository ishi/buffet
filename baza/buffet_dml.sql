Ciężka sytuacja materialna rodziny po śmierci ojca skłoniła go do podjęcia nauki w uniwersyteckim Seminarium Nauczycielskim, co gwarantowało później zatrudnienie w szkołach carskich.

W 1812 miały miejsce dwa ważne wydarzenia w jego życiu: 16 maja umarł jego ojciec, a nieco później przez Nowogródek przeszły wojska Napoleona, maszerujące na Moskwę. Miasto Mickiewicza opanowała atmosfera radości i nadziei na koniec niewoli, jednak kilka miesięcy później ta sama Wielka Armia napoleońska wróciła rozbita i pokonana przez Rosjan.\n\nW 1815 Mickiewicz wyjechał do Wilna w celu podjęcia studiów. Studiował nauki humanistyczne na Uniwersytecie Wileńskim – czołowej uczelni dawnego Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskiego. Studia podjął na Wydziale Nauk Fizycznych i Matematycznych, uczęszczając jednocześnie na wykłady Wydziału Nauk Moralnych i Politycznych oraz Literatury i Sztuk Wyzwolonych. Ciężka sytuacja materialna rodziny po śmierci ojca skłoniła go do podjęcia nauki w uniwersyteckim Seminarium Nauczycielskim, co gwarantowało później zatrudnienie w szkołach carskich. Studia ukończył w 1819 ze stopniem magistra[12].\n\nW okresie studiów w październiku 1817 wespół z Tomaszem Zanem i grupą przyjaciół założył towarzystwo Filomatów, organizację na wzór wolnomularski, która z czasem przekształciła się w spiskową organizację narodowo-patriotyczną. Związek Filomatów, nieco później założony związek Filaretów oraz Promieniści służyły organicznej pracy edukacyjno-patriotycznej polskiej młodzieży wileńskiej tamtego okresu. Organizacje te w 1822 roku liczyły już ponad 200 członków[13]. Ich aktywność, cele i coraz wyraźniejsze proniepodległościowe aspiracje nie uszły czujnej uwadze carskich służb policyjnych. Okres końca lat dwudziestych XIX wieku był też świadkiem niespełnionej wielkiej młodzieńczej miłości Mickiewicza do Maryli Wereszczakówny z Tuhanowicz w powiecie nowogródzkim.
